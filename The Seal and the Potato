There was once a seal, named Seal.
One day, Seal was lying around the beach, minding his own business, enjoying the sea.
The sun was shining, the waves gently rolling on the shore, and the sand was perfectly warm.
Seal was enjoying the nice weather on this perfect day -- he was going to fall asleep.
But, out of nowhere, once vicious seagull decided his lunch, carefully packed
  next to him was the perfect opportunity to claim food and glory.
With a loud cry, the seagull dove for Seal's food.
Seal was too groggy to react in time, but, thankfully, an unlikely hero rolled
  just in time.
A sweet potato saved the day by blocking the seagull from the food.
Seal, now fully awake, asked him for his name.

"Call me Potato."
