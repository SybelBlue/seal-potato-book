After lunch the two friends go home to their respective houses.
Despite their close friendship they live in opposite ends of their beloved
home town of Hottentot. Seal flops slowly toward the foundry area of town,
while potato rolls over 3 bridges, traverses 2 swamps, navigates 4 wooded
areas and finally bobs his way across the moat to get to his house. Potato's
journey is significantly more tumultuous, but that is the price he has to pay
for being such a tasty potato. yum. Then there is a hurricane and all the
bridges break. Seal and potato can no longer meet each other for lunch. BIG SAD.
