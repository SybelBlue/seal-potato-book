It isn't an easy journey.
Seal moved from the Argentina to the North Pole and the potato who
originated in Cape Verde moved to Kuwait, got married and had kids.
 They had not seen each other in over a decade, but had not forgotten about each otherOne day when potato's fingerling
 was at the grocery store, she ran into seal
whom her dad has been talking about and longing to see.
 She took a selfie with
seal and asked her dad, the potato, if this is the seal
he has been looking for,
and her dad was thrilled. He jumped with joy and bought a sandwich to celebrate.
They planned a meeting at the beach, and after 10 years, they finally
 found
each other again.
