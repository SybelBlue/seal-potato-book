It isn't an easy journey.
Seal moved from the Pacific to the Atlantic and the potato who originated in
North America moved to South America, got married and had kids.
One day when potato's daughter was at the grocery store, she ran into seal
whom her dad has been talking about and longing to see. She took a selfie with
seal and asked her dad, the potato, if this is the seal he has been looking for,
and her dad was thrilled.
They planned a meeting at the beach, and after 10 years, they finally found
each other again.
